  /** 
   This is arguably the most complex part of Theodolite. Scopes are an implementation detail of the infrastructure,
   and you should never really have to interact with Scopes if you're working on a Theodolite Component tree.
   
   The core role of scopes is to call render() on each component recursively, and record the children for each
   component. As part of this process of building the component hierarchies, scopes are responsible for matching each
   component with its previous generation, and attaching any prior state, and applying any state updates before calling
   render().
   
   Scopes also keep a reference to the state update listener, and when components call self.updateState(...), they
   actually call through the scope handle to the listener.
   
   One scope is built for each component in the hierarchy.
