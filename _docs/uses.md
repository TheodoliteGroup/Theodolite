Theodolite's primary use case is *UICollectionViews* with complex content as it delivers great scroll performance even with complex items with a wide variety of content, which is quite challenging to achieve using traditional Android views.

You might also consider adopting Theodolite simply for its declarative API for building user interfaces. Theodolite's functional programming model with a unidirectional data flow tends to be much easier to reason about even as your product gets more complex.

Very dynamic UIs with animations and gestures are currently hard to implement in Theodolite. New APIs for layout transitions and gestures in Theodolite are coming soon.
