   What is mounting?

   Mounting is the process by which component hierarchies attach to views. If you're used to working with collection
   views, it's similar in concept to re-configuring cells in cellForItemAt... Components check out views from the
   reuse pools in mount, configure them with a collection of attributes (bg color, etc), and then return the information
   needed to mount the component's children.

   Generally, prefer to override componentWillUnmount() instead since it's much less tricky to get right.
